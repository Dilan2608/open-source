Inspired by 3D worldbuilding and open-source sharing within online computing communities, this collaborative project discovers how individuals can contribute to a larger, singular work of art.

# CONTEXT

![Ascii logo comp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93998190/141463021-1b29e9b6-af60-4f5d-bd2f-005058e3b292.gif)

Through animation and cartoons, I'm launching a visual universe within my artistic practise, with characters and small stories. It would be great if as many of you as possible could be a part of that universe by having your artwork feature in it. 

# HOW IT WORKS

 - The Project to you is to create (draw, caputre, write, make...) an object, video, image or text (anything) that will feature in an animation I am working on.
 - Feature the symbols (after the colons) below in your work (this is not essential but would be cool)
    - 2x: ¬ (similar to a flipped L shape)
    - 1x: * (a three-stroke asterisk)
    - These can be in any configuration or style
 - Then send this as a digital file to: d.dave0320201@arts.ac.uk with the title "OPEN SOURCE"
 - Release will most likely be on Instagram and also on a printed magazine, so please add your @, name or other online links for credit for your art (either on the email or the art)
 - The final animation will be composed in Blender 3D so if you wanted to, creating a digital 3D model (.obj or .blend file etc.) would be great to include as your contribution.
 - This is just a fun project for those who want to be involved, don't overthink it too much, and do as much or as little as you like.
 - In line with the open-source 'philosophy', your art may be slightly modified before final release, but only in ways that make it fit the scene rather than alter the essense of the artwork.
 - Your art will feature in the animation as things such as posters/graffiti on walls, stickers on surfaces, objects in a scene, characters etc.
 - (no offensive art)



# AIMS OF THIS PROJECT
 - To encourage us to come together as individual designers
 - Individual contribution --> Collective result
 - To promote other artists through my artistic practise
 - To see how we can expand principles from the computing world into our world of design (creative computing)
 - To build a visual universe that features work from a greater creative community (inclusivity)

Explanation...

My read me file is similar to a project brief that sets the reader a challenge. This challenge is for the audience to create something that I will fit into a visual world that I am making and eventually presenting as a 3D animation. This thing can be anything, an object, video, image, text and so on.
The idea is that in the end I will have an animation of characters in a world where there are references and "easter eggs" to my creative community's artwork. The art contributions will become things like posters/graffiti on walls, stickers on surfaces, objects in a scene, characters etc.
I added animations to the read.me file that fit the computing theme. I converted 3D renders I made into something called ASCII art which converts images/animations into code text using a character encoding standard for electronic communication.
My project took inspiration from the ideas behind open source computing, particularly how individuals contribute towards this larger picture through honest collabration. I also looked at one of the examples given to us called Digi.Gxl which shines a light on other artists from an underpresented community. I also hope to shine a light on other artists but by directly featuring their work in my animated world. I also liked Digi.Gxl's focus on digital 3D artwork as that's what I've been teaching myself over the past year. Feel free to read the read.me file in your own time if you're interested in being involved in the project.
